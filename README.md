# Pizza Sales Analysis 🍕

Hi there! 👋 This is my SQL project analyzing pizza sales data. I had fun digging into the numbers to find some interesting patterns about how a pizza place operates.

## What's This Project About? 🤔
I analyzed real pizza shop data to help answer questions like:
- How many pizzas are we selling?
- When are we busiest?
- Which pizzas make us the most money?
- What sizes do people love?

## The Data 📊
I worked with 4 main tables:
- Orders (when people bought pizzas)
- Order details (what they ordered)
- Pizzas (sizes and prices)
- Pizza types (categories and names)

## Cool Things I Found 🌟
- Found out which hours are super busy (helpful for staffing!)
- Spotted our best-selling pizzas
- Figured out which pizzas bring in the most cash
- Discovered what sizes people usually go for

## Tech Stuff I Used 💻
- PostgreSQL
- Some fancy SQL tricks like:
  - CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
  - Window functions
  - Different types of JOINs
  - Aggregate functions

## Questions I Tackled 🎯

### Basic Stuff
- Total orders
- Revenue calculations
- Finding expensive pizzas
- Popular sizes
- Top 5 pizzas

### Deeper Dive
- Category analysis
- Busy hours
- Daily order patterns
- Revenue leaders

### Advanced Analysis
- Revenue contribution by pizza type
- Sales trends over time
- Best performers in each category
